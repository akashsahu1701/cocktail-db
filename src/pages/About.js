        The word “cocktail” may conjure up a picture of pleasant surroundings,
        subdued lighting, quiet background music, and behind the bar a friendly
        barman who takes his task of mixing your drink seriously. Or you may
        imagine yourself beside the pool on sunny tropical island, with a tall
        glass of exotic fruit juice, liqueur and crushed ice in your hand.
        Whatever fantasy comes to mind, “cocktail” is the coolest and fantasy
        drink around at the moment.
